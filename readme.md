# Learning Rust with Advent of Code

This repository is my attempt to get familiar with the basics of Rust while *trying to* have some fun at the same time.  

The plan is to use the 2024 edition of Advent of Code as a source of problems to solve and to try and implement them in Rust while reading the [rustbook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Incremental commit messages with details about each improvement should help provide a guide for my thoughts and perhaps I can do a blog series about this at some point in th future.
